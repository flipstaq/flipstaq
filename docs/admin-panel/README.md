# Admin Panel Documentation

## Overview

The Admin Panel provides a web-based interface for managing users, roles, and platform operations. It's integrated into the main Next.js frontend and uses real JWT authentication through the API Gateway.

## üîê Authentication & Access

### Access Levels

The admin panel enforces role-based access control:

- **OWNER**: Full platform access (can manage all users, settings, and data)
- **HIGHER_STAFF**: Elevated backend/admin access
- **STAFF**: Restricted management access
- **USER**: No admin panel access (redirected to main app)

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login Required**: Users must log in via `/auth/signin` with valid credentials
2. **JWT Tokens**: Real JWT tokens issued by `auth-service` (not mock data)
3. **Role Verification**: Frontend checks user role before showing admin interface
4. **API Authorization**: All admin API calls include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
5. **Session Management**: Tokens automatically refreshed or user logged out when expired

### Test Admin Credentials

For development and testing:

- **Email**: `testadmin@flipstaq.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Role**: `OWNER` (full access)

### Access Control Matrix

| User Role    | Can View Modal | Can Change Roles | Can Delete       | Can Restore      |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| OWNER        | All users      | All except OWNER | All except OWNER | All except OWNER |
| HIGHER_STAFF | All users      | STAFF, USER only | STAFF, USER only | STAFF, USER only |
| STAFF        | All users      | None             | None             | None             |
| USER         | No access      | No access        | No access        | No access        |

### Implementation Details

#### **Modal Workflow**

1. User clicks "View" button in user table row
2. Modal opens with selected user data pre-populated
3. Role changes trigger confirmation modal before execution
4. Delete/restore actions close detail modal and open confirmation modal
5. Actions completed with toast notifications and data refresh

#### **Technical Integration**

- **Data Source**: Fetches detailed user information including deletion metadata via `userApi.getUser(id)`
- **Modal State**: Managed via `showDetailModal` and `selectedUser` state
- **Action Handlers**: Integrates with existing confirmation modal system
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid for optimal layout on all screen sizes

#### **Deletion Traceability**

The admin panel provides full audit traceability for user deletions:

**For Deleted Users**:

- **Deletion Date**: Shows exact timestamp when user was deleted
- **Deleted By**: Displays admin name and role who performed the deletion
- **Access Control**: Only OWNER and HIGHER_STAFF can view deletion metadata
- **Visual Indicators**: Grayed out styling and "Deleted" badge

**Implementation**:

- Fetches full user details including `deletedBy` relation on modal open
- Displays deletion metadata in Account Information section
- Respects role-based access for sensitive deletion information
- Integrated with localization system for multi-language support

**Localization Keys**:

- `admin.users.modals.userDetail.deletedAt`: "Deleted At"
- `admin.users.modals.userDetail.deletedBy`: "Deleted By"
- `admin.users.modals.userDetail.deletionInfo`: "This account was deleted by {{adminName}} on {{date}}"

#### **Localization**

All text content is fully localized with support for:

- **English** (`packages/locales/en/admin/users.json`)
- **Arabic** (`packages/locales/ar/admin/users.json`)
- **RTL Layout**: Proper right-to-left text direction for Arabic

### Usage Examples

#### **Opening User Details**

```tsx
// In user table row
<button
  onClick={() => openDetailModal(tableUser)}
  className="rounded bg-blue-600 px-2 py-1 text-xs text-white hover:bg-blue-700"
>
  View
</button>
```

#### **Role Change from Modal**

```tsx
// Role change triggers confirmation
onRoleChange={(user, newRole) => {
  setSelectedUser(user);
  setNewRole(newRole);
  setShowDetailModal(false);  // Close detail modal
  setShowRoleModal(true);     // Open confirmation modal
}}
```

#### **Action Integration**

```tsx
// Actions flow through confirmation system
onDelete={(user) => {
  setSelectedUser(user);
  setShowDetailModal(false);
  setShowDeleteModal(true);
}}
```

## üîß Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. API Gateway Proxy Fix

**Issue**: Auth requests were failing due to incorrect routing path.

**Fix**: Updated `forwardAuthRequest` in API Gateway from `/auth/` to `/internal/auth/`.

**Result**: Authentication now works correctly through the API Gateway.

### 2. Mock Data Removal

**Issue**: Frontend was using hardcoded/mock user data.

**Fix**: Removed all mock authentication and user data from:

- API client configurations
- Frontend components
- Authentication providers

**Result**: Admin panel now displays real users from the database.

### 3. JWT Token Integration

**Issue**: Frontend not properly handling real JWT tokens.

**Fix**: Updated API client to:

- Use real tokens from localStorage
- Include proper Authorization headers
- Handle token expiration correctly

**Result**: All admin API calls now use valid authentication.

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start all services**:

   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd apps/web && npm run dev  # Port 3000

   # API Gateway
   cd apps/api-gateway && npm run start:dev  # Port 3100

   # Auth Service
   cd services/auth-service && npm run start:dev  # Port 3001

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables

Ensure the following are set in production:

```env
# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.flipstaq.com

# API Gateway (.env)
CORS_ORIGINS=https://flipstaq.com,https://admin.flipstaq.com
JWT_SECRET=production-jwt-secret
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://auth-service:3001
USER_SERVICE_URL=http://user-service:3003
```

### Security Considerations

1. **JWT Secrets**: Use strong, unique secrets in production
2. **CORS Origins**: Restrict to actual production domains
3. **HTTPS**: All communication should use TLS in production
4. **Token Expiration**: Short access token lifetimes (15 minutes)
5. **Role Validation**: Server-side role checks on all admin endpoints

### Performance

- **Pagination**: Large user lists are paginated (10-50 per page)
- **Caching**: Consider implementing Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on admin endpoints
